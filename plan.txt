So I want to have the main selector class, as well as a class that handles the storing of recipies I can then make requests using
the main object that make use of these recipies for information. What are our goals as this will determine class structure

1. Store numerous recipies, likely in text files that we can then read from to load up information. 
2. allow for sorting of receipies based on factors like key ingredients, cooking time etc. 
3. allow for the inclusion of new recipies into the system 
4. Separate food items into breakfasts, lunches, and dinners 
5. Allow for some form of random, or curated selction of foods, as well as specific requesting of them

So we need a class for recipies, that will hold their information, and we likely want some form of recipie collection?
Using specific collections of set types will allow for easier searching, we finally want a main class that will take in the search 
requirements and make a search through the others

Let's say two namespaces, Staff and information namespaces 
The Staff namespace contains the criteria specification class and the functionality for using it to make specific requests
The information namespace contains the recipie and recipie collection classes as well as the functions for retrieving 
information from them

---------- Staff Namespace ----------
So we have in this class four main tasks
    1. get the selection criteria
    2. store the selection criteria
    3. make the selection of appropriate recipies 
    4. select and output some number of these appropriate recipies 

    MrDeeds the concierge class can handle the user interaction
    A ticket class can store the requirements 
    A selector class can have selector methods that use the ticket information to acquire some number of recipies

    This is basically the control layer of the project that does the brunt of the work
