So a project is made of multiple diles and directories as ususal, but each file contains one or more <namespaces>

a namespace is a collection of data that houses classes, structs, interfaces etc. They are used to organise classes, such as 
the System namespace containing classes like the console, hence System.Console. Namespaces can be imported into a file with the 
[using] keyword. All namespaces have public access, and they act as a scope delimiter, so assumedly classes in one namespace cannot 
have an identical name, but classes in two different namespaces CAN have the same name, as they would be accessed differently 
Namespace1.Class vs Namespace2.Class. Namespaces are declared using [namespace]

The following are some of the standard namespaces in .NET framework.

System: Contain classes that implement basic functionalities like mathematical operations, data conversions etc.
System.IO: Contains classes used for file I/O operations.
System.Net: Contains class wrappers around underlying network protocols.
System.Collections: Contains classes that implement collections of objects such as lists, hashtable etc.
System.Data: Contains classes that make up ADO.NET data access architecture.
System,Drawing: Contains classes that implement GUI functionalities.
System.Threading: Contains classes that are used for multithreading programming.
System.Web: Classes that implement HTTP protocol to access web pages.
System.Xml: Classes that are used for processing XML data.

to compile and run (at time of writing this) use command
    $ csc .\Concierge.cs .\Config.cs .\Info.cs .\Program.cs; .\Program.exe
